Darwin College Dip Club

Aims: 
 
  The Dipping Club aims to spearhead significant cultural change in the way outdoor swimming and hors d’ouvre are enjoyed among DCSA members. 
 
Objectives:
 
  Provide an environment for DCSA members with peculiar swimming habits, that include outdoor swimming, to enjoy their free water animal spirits in a safe way.
  Taking the members on a journey of tasting different dips from across the world, the society will allow its members to discover a new range of flavours and accompaniments in a truly immersive experience.
  To increase the confidence and knowledge of our members in all levels of the current art, science and culture around open water swimming and dipping sauce preparations.
  Fostering a sense of community and camaraderie amongst dippers, with our values centered around respect, responsibility and safety.
  To rejoice in exuberant delirium sharing our drive for maverick swimming and cracker spreading among the members of our Society.
  Encouraging higher levels of mental clarity for dippers in order to enhance our respective mental wellbeing and performance in the spirit of Charles Darwin, aiding in the successful completion of our arduous studies.[1]
